I remember the last I watched Forrest Gump. It was in my high school, on CCTV6( a famous movie TV channel of China). The first time I watched it, I thought Gump was a lovely big boy. He loves his mother. He loves Jenny. And he is good-hearted. Maybe he is kind of not smart, but I like him.

Yesterday when I was checking the IMDB movies, I saw the title of Forrest Gump, and I thought I could watch it again. Still there is the lovely big boy with a magical life. I started to believe his magical life is not due to how lucky he was, but how consistent he was. Gump was good at running, and he was proud of running. He ran away from the bully. He carried his comrade in the arms and ran away from the battlefield. He ran to Jenny when his love appeared. He ran to his mother when she was dying. He ran when he wanted.

"Are you crazy and plain stupid?" That was what other people said to Gump. Crazy? Or stupid? Stupid is as stupid does. And I believe Gump just wanted to do what he want to. To love someone as he wants, just like to run across America as he wants. Sometimes I hope I can do so. That makes one different.

I am trying to run as I want.
